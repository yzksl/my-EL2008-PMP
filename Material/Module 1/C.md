## C
What is it? High level compiled standardized language
1. Write source files in English
2. Compile source files into executable files that will run on a specific computer  
**Host**: computer the programming is done on  
**Target**: computer that runs the program

#### Language Elements
The C program has two parts:
**Preprocessor directives**: libraries and other things that need to be compiled before the main function. --> *include, define*. Given to C preprocessor.  
**Main function**: main code

#### Variable
Memory cells used for storing a program's input data and its computational results. Can change as the program executes.  
Needs to be declared with the type.
```C
int variable_list;
double variable_list;
char variable_list
```
We need to declare these variables to tell the compiler how much memory to manage and what functions we can use on it

#### Data types
set of values and operations that can be performed on those values.  

sorry bro this is kinda like what we've already learnt before, i'm going to study ros instead
