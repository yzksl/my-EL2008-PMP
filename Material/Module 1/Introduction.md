> [!NOTE]
> First, solve the problem, then write the code  

* Break the problem into components
* Flowchart

> [!WARNING]
> In UTS/UAS, we usually write the solution in paper.

> [!WARNING]
> Every week --> class, lab, homework
> Basically ALPRO but with homework

### Course Outcome
1. Able to solve engineering problems using workstations (IDE)
2. Understand and be able to appply problem solving techniques and skils required by paying attention to constraints and trade-offs --> **memory management**
3. Able to disseminate (**share understandable information**) information related to 
4. Understand ethics in programming and computers
5. Apply problem decomposition to divide tasks --> **teamwork**

## Overview
1. Knowing problem and alternative solutions
2. Algorithm
3. Flowchart/Pseudocode
4. ..

> There are journals and stuff

## AI Regulation
Basically, **we can use AI, but we need to be responsible** for the contents that we submit/share  
**NO AI for quiz or exams** unless stated otehrwise.  
> [!NOTE]
> **MUST declare involvment of AI**

## Class Rules
1. Lecturer is a facilitator, slides summarise the book
2. There is no silly question --> **ask anything**
3. It's okay to say "I don't understand" or "your voice isn't clear"
4. Interrupt anytime if you don't understand, drop a question on Teams, etc
