# Loops
Loop: causes program to eecute the certain block of code repeatedly in a given condition  
Loop body: the statements that are looped

Err it's pretty much the same as alpro and berkom and stuff

### For
for (initialization expression; loop repetition condition; update expression) {
    statement;
    }
e.x.
```c

```

### Increments
`j = ++i` --> j takes prev i  
`j = ++i` --> j takes updated i

### Nested loop
Loop inside a loop

### Iterative Approximation

#### Bisection Routine
A way to find the root of `f(x)` by repeatedly halfing interval a to b 1
